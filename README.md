# Plotting with Seaborn

This repository contains exercises related to data visualization using Seaborn. You will need to use Pandas to perform data manipulation and Seaborn for plotting. 

## Exercises

### 1. Create a *lineplot* showing how **Study Time** varies by **Student Name**. Which student has the highest study time?
- **Goal**: Use Seaborn's `lineplot` to visualize the variation in study time for each student.
- **Insight**: Identify the student with the highest study time.

### 2. Plot a histogram (*histplot*) of **Grade** and determine which grade range has the highest frequency of students.
- **Goal**: Create a histogram using Seaborn's `histplot` to understand the distribution of student grades.
- **Insight**: Find out which grade range has the highest frequency of students. You may need to check if there are multiple grade ranges with the same highest frequency.

### 3. Create an ECDF plot (*ecdfplot*) for **Grade**. What is the percentage of students scoring less than 85?
- **Goal**: Use Seaborn's `ecdfplot` to plot the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of grades.
- **Insight**: Calculate the percentage of students whose grade is below 85.

### 4. Create a *stripplot* showing **Grade** distribution for each **Course**. Which course has the most spread in grades?
- **Goal**: Use Seaborn's `stripplot` to show the distribution of grades for each course.
- **Insight**: Identify which course has the widest distribution of grades.

### 5. Create a *swarmplot* to show the relationship between Gender and **Study Time**. Which gender has a higher average study time?
- **Goal**: Use Seaborn's `swarmplot` to visualize the relationship between gender and study time.
- **Insight**: Compare the average study time between genders.

### 6. Plot a *pointplot* to show the average **Grade** for each Course. Which course has the highest average grade?
- **Goal**: Use Seaborn's `pointplot` to plot the average grade for each course.
- **Insight**: Determine which course has the highest average grade.
